// At this moment, we have created our React application and would like to host our application in Github for free.

// You can install Git and Github from their official sites, respectively.

// Deploying TextUtils
// Whenever we create our application for production, we build it using the npm run build command and not by using npm start.

// npm run build: npm run build bundles the app into static files for production, i.e. it creates a build folder that contains your application as a static application.

// In Build Folder: If you open your build folder in the live server, you will find that your application is working perfectly, which means our application is being converted into static files for deployment.




// Note: React Router doesnâ€™t work perfectly with Github pages, so we are going to remove the router from our application. But remember that while deploying in the server, it runs perfectly.








// Steps for Hosting our React Application:(Method 1)


// 1. Add the Home page field:

// You can add the homepage field in your application by Copying the below code in your package.json.(in starting above name)

// "homepage": "https://myusername.github.io/my-app",

// Make sure to enter your username and the correct name of your application in the mentioned places in the above URL





// 2. Install gh-pages

// Use the below command to install gh-pages in your React app.

// npm install --save gh-pages





// 3. Add the script in "package.json"
