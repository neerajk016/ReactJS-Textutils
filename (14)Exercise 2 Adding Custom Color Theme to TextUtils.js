// Challenge-1:  Add a color palette to our application.

// It would be astounding if any one of you can provide us the code to add the color palette in the navbar section of our Textutils application. You have to add functions to each button of the color palette such that clicking on the button changes our Blue-Dark mode with any other type of dark mode, like Red-Dark mode, Green-Dark mode, or any other theme color.


// Challenge-2: Write the JavaScript logic to fix the Word Counting issue.

// We are facing the issue of word counting in our application. Our application is counting space at the end as a word, due to which an extra word is always counted.
